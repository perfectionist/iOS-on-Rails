# Learn How to Create Native iOS Clients for Rails Applications

## Course Overview

Let's face it: these days, everyone wants an app. 

Sure, you could _technically_ use PhoneGap or Titanium, but _nothing_ compares to a native experience.  Objective-C may be a scary-looking language (especially for us Rubyists), but under all of those semicolons and square brackets is an elegant, powerful framework. Once you learn the ropes, you'll never want to go back.

In this course, you'll get over your fears of Objective-C and UIKit, and learn how to make iOS apps that talk to a Rails backend.

## What You'll Learn

* How to read and write in Objective-C like a pro
* How to build iOS apps that use UIKit, MapKit, and other frameworks
* How to create a Rails backend for your iOS app
* How to communicate between the client and server

## Prerequisites

This course assumes a basic working knowledge of Rails and Ruby. No previous Objective-C or iOS programming is required, but you should be comfortable with OOP in general.
